# React + Redux Toolkit

Today, I delved into Redux Toolkit! Watched a YT video, then built a project. Implemented it myself (ChatGPT is silent). It fetches data from an API. When you add an item to the cart, it stores in Redux. And when you remove from the cart, it's removed from the store. Once a item is added to the cart you can't add it again.
